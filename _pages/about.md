Welcome to our research group! Our group is led by Prof. Chen. Our research is centered around **quantum physics and quantum computing**. Our current research interests include:

* **Quantum computing**: quantum algorithms, quantum simulation, quantum information, and quantum software for quantum computing.

* **Open quantum systems**: quantum noise characterizing, simulation and mitigation for quantum device; novel physics for condensed matter systems in open environment.

* **Artificial intelligence**: the interaction between machine learning's infrastructure, models, and concepts with the realms of quantum physics, quantum computing, and quantum control.
